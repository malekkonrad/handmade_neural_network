## Neural Network
Implementation of my Neural Network library.
Currently created GUI to draw and predict what handwritten number from 0 to 9 it is to augment training dataset.
Work in progress..

#### Available avtivation functions:
* Sigmoid
* Tanh   (in progress)

#### Layers:
* Dense

#### Optimizers:
* SGD

#### Loss/Cost functions:
* MSE
* Binary-Cross-Entropy (in progress)
* Softmax-Cross-Entropy (in progress)
